      question: 'Do you use all-in-one platforms to build the website?',
      answer:
        'No, I develop all of the code myself. This not only offers you flexibility but also gives you more control and options for your website that are not possible with all-in-one solutions. I prioritize integrity in my work, ensuring that every aspect of your website is tailored to your specific needs and preferences.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does it take to create a fully customized website?',
      answer:
        'The time it takes to design and build a custom website is dependent on the complexity of the project. A simple, static website could be completed in several weeks, while a large, complex website could take several months. During the initial consultation, I will set expectations about the timeline and how long I think your project will take. I prioritize quality and excellence in my work, ensuring that your website is meticulously crafted to meet your standards and exceed your expectations.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the pricing work? Am I expected to pay up front?',
      answer:
        'You are not expected to pay in full upfront. Once we have discussed your needs and I have given you a quote, we can work out a payment plan. Generally, I request that half of the quote is paid before I start work. I believe in customer-centricity, and I strive to make the payment process as transparent and flexible as possible to accommodate your budget and preferences.',
    },
    {
      question:
        'How much say will I have in the design and development process?',
      answer:
        'As much as you want. I want you to have a product that you love on your terms. If you want to be hands-on, I welcome that, and if that is not your style, that is okay too. I prioritize adaptability in my approach, tailoring the design and development process to fit your communication style and level of involvement.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why should I choose your services over a larger company?',
      answer:
        'I am dedicated to giving each of my clients a hands-on experience. I prioritize customer-centricity, ensuring that your needs are heard, understood, and prioritized throughout the entire process. With a passion for excellence, I am committed to delivering a website that not only meets but exceeds your expectations.',
    },
    {
      question:
        'I only need some small changes to my website. Can you still help me?',
      answer:
        "Of course. No change is too small. I am passionate about helping you achieve your vision, whether it's a small tweak or a complete overhaul. Every project, regardless of size, receives the same level of attention to detail and dedication to excellence.",
